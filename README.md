# Project1
# Machine learning project done by Justine Montavon Kevin Rizk, and Louis  Auzeau
This project was done for the project 1 of EPFL Higg boson challenge. It will use machine learning techniques to train a function on the train data and then make a prediciton on the test data set.

Here is a guideline (subjective) and how to proceed and run the program to make the predictions. To be able to run the program you need to have pyhton 3 or  installed , python 2.7 or pyhton3.8 could also works but it was not tested

Step 1 : Go to the data folder and extract the zip file of train.csv and test.csv
Step 2: Open the terminal or the cmd (windows) and position your self using the commend "cd your_Path" in the folder.
Step 3: Run on the cmd or terminal the commend "pyhton3 run.py", waiting some minutes (There will be some info on the command line in which step we are ) before the code is finished and it will produce "final_submission.csv" file which will be the prediction of the test file.
