# Project1
# Machine learning project done by Justine Montavon Kevin Rizk, and Louis  Auzeau
This project was done for the project 1 of EPFL Higg boson challenge. It will use machine learning techniques to train a function on the train data and then make a prediciton on the test data set.

Here is a guideline (subjective) and how to proceed and run the program to make the predictions file. To be able to run the program you need to have pyhton 3   installed.python 2.7 or pyhton 3.8 could also works but it was not tested.

The code is documented if you want to make any change or use another fucntion or to understand what each function does.

#Step 1 : Go to the data folder and extract the zip file of train.csv and test.csv

#Step 2: Open the terminal or the cmd (windows) and position your self in the folder using the commend "cd your_folder_Path" 

#Step 3: Run on the cmd or terminal the commend "pyhton3 run.py". The code will run and you will know at which step you are as the code is running. When it is finished, it will produce "final_submission.csv" the file for which will be the prediction of the test file.
