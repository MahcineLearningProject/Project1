# Project1
# Machine learning project done by Justine Montavon Kevin Rizk, and Louis  Auzeau
This project was done for the project 1 of "EPFL Higgs boson challenge". It will use machine learning techniques to train a function on the train data and then make a prediciton on the test data set.

Here is a guideline (subjective) and how to proceed and run the program to make the predictions file. To be able to run the program you need to have python 3  installed. Python 2.7 or python 3.8 could also works but it was not tested.

The code is documented if you want to make any change or use another fucntion or to understand what each function does.

#Step 1 : Go to the data folder and extract if not already done the zip file of train.csv and test.csv. Make sure that the csv files are in the folder data

#Step 2: Open the terminal or the cmd (windows) and position yourself in the folder where the file run.py is located using the commend "cd your_folder_Path" for example or any other method. 

#Step 3: Run on the cmd or terminal the command "python3 run.py". The code will run and will let you know at which step you are as the code is running. When it is finished, it will print the message "FINISHED" and produce a file named "final_submission.csv". This file contains our prediction for the test file.
